EVEREST SPECIALTY UNDERWRITERS DECLINATION LETTER

Dear Christopher Treanor:

Thank you for considering Everest as a market for the account referenced above. After a review of the Submission, we regret to inform you that we must decline coverage at this time because the exposure or operations are outside our underwriting appetite.

We appreciate your business and look forward to working with you on future opportunities. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,
Calin Hynson
